# Introduction

Growing degree days (GDD) are a meausre of heat accumulation, which can predict the date that a flower will bloom or maturity of a insect. The calculation of GDD is given in the following formula:

GDD=(T_max+T_min)/2-T_base. 

where T_max is the maximum daily temperature, T_min is the minimum daily temperature. The base temperature(T_base) usually set to be 10 celsius, moreover, if T_max or T_min are less than T_base, then set them to be T_base which guarantees GDD always greater than zero. In our project, we try to calculate accumulated GDD for the following cities: St.John's, Halifax, Toronto and Vancouver.

# Method
In our project, firstly, we wrote a python program to download the historical data from web automatically, secondly we plotted the maximun and minimun daily temperature of our given cities. By using the maximun and minimun temperature we calculated the accumulated GDD of the four cities and did the plot for accumulated GDD.

# Summary
From our graphs of accumulated GDD for the given cities, we conclude the following results:
1. max and min  
2. GDD
3. CITY
4. RESULT
