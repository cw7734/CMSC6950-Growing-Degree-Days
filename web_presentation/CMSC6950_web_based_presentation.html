# Introduction

Growing degree days (GDD) are a meausre of heat accumulation, which can predict the date that a flower will bloom or maturity of a insect. The calculation of GDD is given in the following formula:

GDD=(T_max+T_min)/2-T_base. 

where T_max is the maximum daily temperature, T_min is the minimum daily temperature. The base temperature(T_base) usually set to be 10 celsius, moreover, if T_max or T_min are less than T_base, then set them to be T_base which guarantees GDD always greater than zero. In our project, we try to calculate accumulated GDD for the following cities: St.John's, Halifax, Toronto and Vancouver.

# Summary
From our graphs of accumulated GDD for the given cities, we conclude the following results:
1. In the same year, Toronto and Vancouver have higher value of accumulated GDD than Halifax and St.John's
2. From year 2013 to year 2016, the accumulated GDD values for our selected cities are not always growing up.
3. In Totonto and Vancouver there are more plants and insects can grow to be maturity than Halifax and St.John's.
